A home for my squigglebin; all one-off utilities not needing their own dedicated repo.


== conf
Config files aren't really in a standardized place.

Sometimes it's _/etc/_, oftentimes a dotfile in your homedir, other times under _~/.config_.

`conf` assigns short names to each dotfile for easier editing. E.g.,

[source,bash]
----
# create entry for your ~/.bashrc
conf bash set ~/.bashrc

# launch in $EDITOR
conf bash

# create group for related configs
conf nvim.colors set ~/.config/nvim/colors/*

# launch in $EDITOR, supplying additional arguments
conf nvim.colors edit -O3
----


== roam
Laptop is bad at WAP handoffs between my bedroom and office.
Needed a way to force it over to the correct one.

This gives a quick CLI, TUI, or graphical approach.
